                       We have two main objectives, one is to remember our dearest friends always as they were very talented and bright students, If they are here with us physically, they must be reached top level with their respective streams of Medicine and Engineering. The other main objective is to help students whoever needs financial support to continue their studies and as well as to help our school in different ways. We are not limited to only Hartley students; we do support the other Schools as well. We are proudly say that, with the support of all of our friends, we have supported many students within the past 4 years.
 	
We are gathered here with the help of social media and we don't have a committee, President & Secretary etc. Only one coordinator from Sri Lanka to coordinate with the school & with the friends network and few friends to organize the annual events such as the blood donation camp, remembering day and etc.. We assure that, every single cent from the donations will be spent only for our objectives not to have meetings or get together. 
 
We request all our friends to join hands together with MTHS to make our dream very successful. We request the support from the old students from the other schools as well.
 
We thank all the friends from all over the world for their support and guidance to build this fund and make this very success and we expect the same for future as well.
